# netflix-clone
Clone of Netflix Home Page using ReactJS

Got the list of movies and TV Shows from TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/).
Create an account and access the list by getting an API key.

After getting the access, I segregated the movies according to the categories using the API docs.

Pulled the necessary info to dispa=lay like the category name and images.

Adjusted the row heights, Created the Banner and Navbar to get the similar structure of Netflix.

Added Trailers to the list of movies by using feature of TMDB which is the moviedb-wrapper.
